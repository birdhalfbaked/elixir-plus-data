# elixir-plus-data
Learning some elixir and how to abuse the %Â¤#! for data engineering purposes


## Part one: Generating random data

Okay this can be pretty fun, let's see how the hell you generate CSVs using elixir.

### GOALS

* ~~Be able to create a CSV file~~
* ~~Generate data in CSVs based on a fixed Schema~~

### Bonus Goals

* ~~Be able to generate more random data based on the schema of an example input file~~
* ~~Parameterize cli version~~ - apparently the experts just downright say "don't do this"

Okay first goal complete. Excellent. getting the hang of this

## Part two: Trying out some of the scaling out functionality

Supposedly easy to scale out bootstrapped processes. Let's see I guess.

### GOALS

* Scale out the csv generation functionality above so it is one csv generated by each process.
* figure out how to read across either IPC or shared channels or however Elixir does this black magic and have shared state of any sort

### Bonus Goals

* dynamic spawning based on "load" that can be simulated
